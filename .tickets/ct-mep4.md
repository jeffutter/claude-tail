# Improve UI responsiveness

The UI is still unresponsive. Pressing up/down in the conversation view or tabbing between columns feels like it only re-draws every few seconds. I'm not entirely sure when this gets bad, because sometimes it _is_ responsive. It _might_ be when a session has activity and is updating. It also might be from when the contents of the project lists are updating. Explore these options among others.
